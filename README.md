# Capstone1L3---CRM-SQL

This is building on from the basic Python CRM management tool.

Focusing on OOP I have integrated the program to manage data via MySql

The program will now store multiple projects and client data on a local MySql server 

Open projects can be editied via the program

All new projects will follow the same naming mechanism to avoid jumbled data

Defensive programming has been used to avoid invalid inputs such as strings where a int / double is required

Automatically generates an invoice for a client based on fees outstanding and fees paid in the beginning as a deposit
